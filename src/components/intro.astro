                Yolo Community Band has a goal to foster community through 
                the passion of our musicianship, artistry, and friendship.

                <br />
                We not only believe this to be true within what we put 
                into every rehearsal and moment together as an ensemble, 
                but have a goal and hope that our sharing of our fellowship and musicality 
                will have a positive impact on many in the Yolo community and beyond.</p>
